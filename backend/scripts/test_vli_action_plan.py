BUNKER_PLAN = """### **Bunker Mode Design: Time-Horizon Selection**

To advance the design discussion, we must address the **Structural Hierarchy** during a Bunker regime.
When the $20–$50 and RVOL requirements are relaxed, we are often dealing with "Shields" 
that possess significantly deeper liquidity pools (e.g., $XLE, $ITA, or Mega-caps like $WM).

**Sortino-Relative Strength (SRS) Integration:**
In the DeerFlow 2.0 design, the **Analyst Agent** will run a "Sweep" of the 1-Hour charts *only* 
for symbols that have cleared the Daily/4-Hour Sortino hurdle ($S_{DR} >= 2.0$).

Please create me a new watchlist window for Futures to monitor these shields.
